      <h2>Speech Recognition</h2>
      <p>Speech recognition is an AI technology that enables computers to transcribe spoken language into text. It allows users to interact with devices and applications using voice commands, making human-computer interaction more natural and intuitive.</p>
      <p>Speech recognition systems utilize sophisticated algorithms and machine learning techniques to analyze audio input, identify speech patterns, and convert spoken words into text. These systems can handle various accents, languages, and speech styles, making them versatile and adaptable to different user contexts.</p>
      <p>Applications of speech recognition include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Virtual Assistants:</strong> Speech recognition powers virtual assistants like Siri, Google Assistant, and Alexa, allowing users to perform tasks such as setting reminders, sending messages, and searching the web using voice commands.</li>
        <li><strong>Transcription Services:</strong> Speech recognition technology is used to transcribe audio recordings, such as meetings, interviews, and lectures, into text, enabling efficient documentation and accessibility.</li>
        <li><strong>Voice-controlled Interfaces:</strong> Speech recognition enables hands-free control of devices and applications, such as smart home systems, automotive infotainment systems, and voice-activated appliances.</li>
        <li><strong>Accessibility Tools:</strong> Speech recognition helps individuals with disabilities, such as those with mobility impairments or visual impairments, to interact with technology and access digital content through voice input.</li>
        <li><strong>Call Center Automation:</strong> Speech recognition is employed in call centers to automate customer service interactions, route calls, and analyze customer sentiment, improving efficiency and enhancing the customer experience.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Speech recognition technology continues to advance rapidly, with improvements in accuracy, speed, and language support. It plays a crucial role in enabling seamless and natural human-machine communication, unlocking new possibilities for interaction and productivity.</p>
