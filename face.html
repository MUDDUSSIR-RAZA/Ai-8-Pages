      <h2>Face Recognition</h2>
      <p>Face recognition is a technology that identifies or verifies a person's identity by analyzing and comparing patterns based on facial features. It is a subset of biometric identification and has applications in various fields, including security, surveillance, access control, and personalization.</p>
      <p>Face recognition systems typically work by capturing an image or video of a person's face, extracting facial features such as the distance between the eyes, nose, and mouth, and then comparing these features to a database of known faces. The process may involve facial detection, alignment, normalization, and feature extraction.</p>
      <p>Advanced face recognition algorithms use deep learning techniques to train models that can accurately identify individuals even in challenging conditions such as varying lighting, angles, facial expressions, and occlusions. These algorithms can also perform facial verification, which confirms whether a person's face matches a specific identity.</p>
      <p>Face recognition technology has a wide range of applications, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Security and Surveillance:</strong> Face recognition is used for access control, identity verification, and monitoring of public spaces to enhance security and safety.</li>
        <li><strong>Personal Devices:</strong> Many smartphones, tablets, and laptops incorporate face recognition technology for unlocking devices, authorizing transactions, and personalizing user experiences.</li>
        <li><strong>Law Enforcement:</strong> Police and law enforcement agencies use face recognition systems for criminal identification, suspect tracking, and forensic investigations.</li>
        <li><strong>Retail and Marketing:</strong> Face recognition can be used in retail stores and marketing campaigns for customer engagement, demographic analysis, and targeted advertising.</li>
        <li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> In healthcare settings, face recognition systems can assist with patient identification, access control to medical records, and monitoring patient movements within facilities.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>While face recognition technology offers many benefits, it also raises concerns about privacy, surveillance, bias, and the potential for misuse. Ethical considerations and regulatory frameworks are essential to ensure responsible deployment and use of face recognition systems.</p>
